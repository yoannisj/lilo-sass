# Lilo

Lilo is a small Sass framework to help sharing styles between classes and components. It pushes the Sam Richard's [DRY mixin technique](http://alistapart.com/article/dry-ing-out-your-sass-mixins) further by also allowing to share dynamic styles.

Lilo is the diminituve of the german name Liselotte, and means *'the generous one'*.

## Sharing styles carefully

Use this very carefully since it relies on the `@extend` directive which, despite it's benefits, also comes with its downsides]. More info:
